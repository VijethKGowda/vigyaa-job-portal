(Those in the know call us YNAB, which is pronounced “why-nab.”) For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. \u003ca href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=ynab\"\u003eGoogle us\u003c/a\u003e, or read some of our \u003ca href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ynab-you-need-a-budget/id1010865877\"\u003ereviews on the app store\u003c/a\u003e, and you’ll see what we mean. We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have big plans for our entire app ecosystem, including our \u003ca href=\"https://app.youneedabudget.com\"\u003eweb app\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://api.youneedabudget.com/\"\u003eAPI\u003c/a\u003e. All of those plans necessitate changes on our back-end that runs on Rails/Postgres and our front-end Ember app written in TypeScript. That’s where you come in!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our \u003ca href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/16hufsixsrv1j2jZkWUgQmeKpNfQRsacnnK2xTVwO0ew/edit\"\u003eCultural Manifesto\u003c/a\u003e has to really \u003cem\u003eclick\u003c/em\u003e with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading this, you’ll probably fit right in!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, we have some firm* requirements too, like five years of full-stack professional web application development experience. For us this means you either know the server-side really well and have some client-side experience, or you’re an absolute expert on front-end development and have some server-side know-how.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Well, firm-\u003cem\u003eish\u003c/em\u003e.

How you pitch us is up to you, just make sure it’s short and creative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, let’s talk about life at YNAB, and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho You’d Be Working With\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur developer team is about 25 people strong, and we frequently operate in cross-functional teams, so you’ll get to work with awesome people from all different roles in the company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegardless of their varied interests, all of our developers have one thing in common: They are a joy to work with. You won’t find heated arguments and raised voices here. We save our competitive spirit for YNAB’s external competitors (or the occasional lively board game session), but internally we build up our teammates and celebrate their successes. We all love to program and solve problems in creative ways, and we regularly take time to geek out and show each other something cool we built or found to make our lives easier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd of course, as a developer, you’ll work closely with our amazing designers. They have the awards (including at least one actual Emmy®) to prove they’re good at designing stuff. More importantly, they welcome feedback and suggestions during the development process and are happy to tweak an interaction if you tell them it will save you significant development effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow You’ll Work at YNAB\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe strive hard to make working at YNAB a unique and fantastic experience (we’ve even been named \u003ca href=\"https://fortune.com/best-small-workplaces/you-need-a-budget/\"\u003eFortune’s #1 Best Small Company to Work For\u003c/a\u003e). We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with.

We empower them to do what they think is right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe also work collaboratively. We continuously seek the right amount of structure and unity necessary to maximize productivity. Where it makes sense, we designate someone to make a call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though our developers are right a lot, it's okay to make mistakes here. Exploration and calculated risks are vital to velocity and growth. We freely admit when we're wrong. If something doesn't go as expected, we learn, bounce back, and make corrections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou won't be alone; others will be there to help, review, reassure, and back you up. We own our processes and collective outcomes as a team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLive Where You Want\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want, as long as it’s somewhere between the Pacific Time Zone (UTC-8) and the Central European Time Zone (UTC+1). Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNo Crazy Hours\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe want everyone to have a full life outside of YNAB. We seldom work more than 40 hours per week. There have been rare occasions where things got a little crazy, and people logged some extra hours. But then they took additional time off to balance it all out. We work hard and smart, but we’re in this for the long haul; there’s no need to go crazy on the hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTake Vacation (Seriously)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a minimum vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for Holiday break). It’s important to get plenty of downtime and get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your adventures in our #office_wall Slack channel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe YNAB Retreat\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the pandemic isn’t keeping us from traveling, we get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room.

We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, Lynda/Skillshare subscriptions, books, and dedicated time away from work to learn something new.

If you’re international, you’ll be set up as a contractor. We are already spread across the world: Switzerland, Scotland, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Germany, Canada, and all over the United States.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBenefits\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe offer excellent health, dental, and vision insurance for our US employees, where we cover 100% of the premium for you and your family. (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, we’ve got you covered!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe also have a Traditional and Roth 401k option. YNAB matches your contributions, up to six percent of your paycheck. Matches vest immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like our founder Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not your retirement nest egg. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a PF junkie? Trust us, it’s awesome.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCompetitive Compensation\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe use a leading compensation data provider to set competitive and well-defined pay ranges for all of our positions. Your pay is the same no matter where you live, and our goal is to pay at or above the market rate in the United States. We consider raises every year and have a bonus plan based on profitability, which you’re in on from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOther Tidbits\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOnce you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe bucket list really helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and the holidays.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWe’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor. We look at what you accomplish, not how long you sit (have you tried \u003cem\u003estanding\u003c/em\u003e?) in front of a computer.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWe want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a top-of-the-line computer and phone and will replace them regularly.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDid we mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now we want to talk about you.

We work in small, cross-functional teams where you will likely find yourself responsible for implementation on both the back-end (Rails and Postgres), as well as the front-end (using Ember or Vue and written in TypeScript).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf your focus has been more on front-end development, then you're among the best of the best with a client-side framework such as Ember and also have some server-side depth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’re not necessarily the “Ops” person where you work, but you certainly understand the infrastructure well enough to aid in architecting and maintaining scalable solutions. We host on Heroku, so experience there is a bonus, but experience with AWS or other popular IAAS/PAAS is just fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’ll do things like help vet and improve our server-side layer, implement new features, integrate with third-party APIs, and shepherd our application. We might have conversations that start like this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e“How can we be certain that our application is going to scale as we grow? How did the other apps you worked on handle similar load conditions?”\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e“We want to expose these parts of the API to 3rd party developers. Will that API need to differ from our internal API, and if so, how?”\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e“We want to make it possible for users to sort their transactions in a new way, and we are thinking of using drag-and-drop to make that possible. What changes on our client and server will be necessary to accomplish this?”\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e“We need to integrate a new data aggregation partner to connect bank accounts and import transactions.

If the database layer turns out to be the culprit behind an issue, it’s not a black box to you. (Experience with Postgres is a bonus.)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYou have an understanding of algorithms and data structures beyond arrays and “for loops.” That doesn’t mean you have to be a computer science PhD or even that you have to know “Big O” notation, but you should know when to use a Dictionary/Map, and why finding an element in a sorted array is faster than finding an element in an unsorted array.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhile perhaps not a security specialist, you are aware of how websites and services can be exploited, are security conscious while you code, and protective of customer data and privacy.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYou have excellent debugging skills. You know how to find problems and how to architect apps so that problems are discoverable in the first place.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYou already use and love YNAB.
